# Vehicle Data Analysis

## Overview

This project involves analyzing a dataset of vehicles to extract various insights and statistics. The dataset contains information on vehicles including their manufacturing year, selling price, fuel type, transmission type, and more. The analysis focuses on understanding vehicle depreciation, identifying trends, and examining the characteristics of different types of vehicles.

## Dataset

The dataset is in CSV format and is named `car_Dekho_DA.csv`. It includes the following columns:

- `Car_Name`: Name of the car
- `Year`: Manufacturing year of the car
- `Selling_Price`: Selling price of the car (in lakhs)
- `Present_Price`: Present price of the car (in lakhs)
- `Kms_Driven`: Distance driven by the car (in kilometers)
- `Fuel_Type`: Type of fuel used (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, CNG)
- `Transmission`: Type of transmission (e.g., Manual, Automatic)
- `Owner`: Number of owners of the vehicle
- `Seller_Type`: Type of seller (e.g., Individual, Dealer)

## Analysis

1. **Manufacturing Years Covered**
   - Vehicles range from the manufacturing year 2003 to 2018.

2. **Price Insights**
   - Lowest selling price: `lowest_price_vehicle_sold` lakhs
   - Highest selling price: `highest_price_vehicle_sold` lakhs

3. **Data Records**
   - Total number of records: `no_of_records`

4. **Missing Records**
   - The dataset does not contain any missing records.

5. **Vehicle Diversity**
   - Number of different vehicles: `different_vehicles`

6. **Most Sold Vehicle**
   - The most sold vehicle is: `most_sold_car`

7. **CNG Vehicles**
   - Number of CNG vehicles: `no_of_cng`

8. **Vehicles Sold by Individuals**
   - Number of vehicles sold by individuals: `indi_count`

9. **Auto Transmission Vehicles**
   - The dataset includes auto transmission vehicles. Number of auto transmission vehicles: `auto_transmission_count`

10. **Single Person Owned Vehicles**
    - Distribution of single, two, and multiple owners.

11. **Depreciation Analysis**
    - The most depreciated vehicle: Details provided
    - The least depreciated vehicle: Details provided

12. **Depreciation by Brand**
    - Depreciation trends across different vehicle brands.

13. **Factors Affecting Depreciation**
    - Analysis of factors such as kilometers driven on cost depreciation.

14. **Impact of Age and Distance on Selling Price**
    - Analysis of the relationship between age, kilometers driven, and selling price.

15. **Newest Vehicles**
    - Vehicles manufactured after 2014.

16. **Two-Wheeler Analysis**
    - Data filtered to include only two-wheelers.
    - Oldest bike sold: `oldest_bike`
    - Newest bike sold: `newest_bike`
    - Most sold bike: `most_sold_bike`
    - Deals exceeding general expectations and their reasons.

17. **Car Analysis**
    - Data filtered to include only cars.
    - Oldest car sold: `oldest_car`
    - Newest car sold: `newest_car`
    - Deals exceeding general expectations and their reasons.

## Visualization

- Various plots and charts were generated using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to visualize the data and trends.
- Examples include scatter plots for depreciation vs. kilometers driven, selling price vs. kilometers driven, and boxplots for price distributions.

## How to Run

1. Install required libraries:
   bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   

2. Run the analysis script:
   python
   import pandas as pd
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import seaborn as sns

   df = pd.read_csv("/content/car_Dekho_DA.csv")
   # Add the code from the analysis here
   

## Conclusion

This analysis provides insights into vehicle pricing, depreciation, and other factors affecting the selling price. The results can help in understanding market trends and making informed decisions in the automotive domain.
